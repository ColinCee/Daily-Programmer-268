This is a Java implementation of the daily challenge, it is multithreaded server that has some of the bonuses as shown below:

Make the server broadcast it's existince on the network, so clients can detect him. - I don't know how to do this :/
Send messages to the server and broadcast it to all the clients - Nope
Let the client identify itself (username) - Yep
Create a way to list all connected clients - Yep
Send messages to the server and relay it to a requested client - Nope
